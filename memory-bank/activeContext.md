# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

### Just Completed (Phase 3 Premium System)
✅ **Premium vs Free User Differentiation**
- Implemented two-tier system with different capabilities
- Premium users: Automatic language detection (GPT + Whisper)
- Free users: Manual language selection via buttons

✅ **Hidden Dev Commands**
- `/go_premium` - switches user to premium status
- `/go_free` - switches user to free status
- Commands are not documented publicly (dev-only)

✅ **User Experience Optimization**
- Removed chat functionality completely (buttons and handlers)
- Simplified button layout for better UX
- Different processing flows for Premium vs Free users

✅ **Technical Improvements**
- Updated GPT model to gpt-4o-nano for better performance
- Implemented pending audio system for Free users
- Enhanced error handling and cleanup

## Current State

### Working Features
- ✅ Telegram bot startup and basic commands
- ✅ Premium/Free user differentiation 
- ✅ Voice message processing for both user types
- ✅ Language settings and switching
- ✅ OpenAI integration (Whisper + GPT)
- ✅ MongoDB user management
- ✅ Token usage tracking and limits
- ✅ Docker deployment setup

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Bot conflict error (409) when multiple instances try to start
- ⚠️ MongoDB deprecated options warnings (useNewUrlParser, useUnifiedTopology)
- ⚠️ Need to kill existing processes before restart

### Current Challenge
**Bot Instance Management**: The bot sometimes fails to start due to existing instance conflicts. Need to implement better process management or use process managers like PM2.

## Recent Changes (Latest Session)

### 1. Dev Commands Implementation
- Added hidden `/go_premium` and `/go_free` commands
- Commands registered in bot.js and implemented in commandHandlers.js
- No public documentation (development use only)

### 2. Chat Functionality Removal
- Deleted all chat-related buttons from UI
- Removed handlers for "Новий чат" and "Історія чатів"
- Simplified menu structures across all commands

### 3. Free User Experience Redesign
- Free users no longer get automatic language detection
- Instead, they see language selection buttons after voice upload
- Audio files stored temporarily until user makes selection
- Implements callback system for delayed processing

### 4. Technical Updates
- Changed GPT model from gpt-4.1-nano to gpt-4o-nano
- Enhanced callbackHandlers.js with new free user workflow
- Improved error handling in audio processing

## Next Steps (Immediate)

### Priority 1: Process Management
- Investigate bot instance conflicts
- Consider implementing PM2 or similar process manager
- Add better startup checks and cleanup

### Priority 2: Testing & Validation
- Test dev commands functionality
- Validate Free vs Premium user experiences
- Test language detection accuracy with new model

### Priority 3: UI/UX Polish
- Verify button layouts are intuitive
- Test edge cases in user flows
- Optimize response messages

## Decisions Made

### User Experience Strategy
- **Premium Focus**: Automatic detection with verification for paying users
- **Free Limitations**: Manual selection to encourage premium upgrades
- **Clean Interface**: Removed complex chat features for simplicity

### Technical Architecture
- **Stateless Design**: Minimal session storage except pending audio
- **Clear Separation**: Different code paths for Premium vs Free
- **Memory Management**: Temporary audio cleanup after processing

### Development Approach
- **Hidden Features**: Dev commands for testing without user confusion
- **Incremental Testing**: Phase-by-phase feature validation
- **Documentation First**: Memory bank for knowledge preservation

## Context for Next Session
When resuming work, remember:
1. Bot may need process cleanup before starting
2. Premium/Free logic is fully implemented but needs testing
3. Memory bank system is now initialized
4. All chat functionality has been removed
5. Focus should be on validation and polish rather than new features
